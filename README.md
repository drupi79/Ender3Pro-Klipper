# Ender3Pro-Klipper

I have spent a fair amount of time converting my heavily modified Ender 3 Pro with the Creality v4.2.7 Mainboard to Klipper. After many revisions and significant hardware changes, these are my current working config files.

I followed Ellis’ Print Tuning Guide once I had the printer running to tune my printer. I’d suggest if you have never done a Klipper Conversion before follow that tuning guide to the letter. It hasn’t failed 
me yet across multiple printers to get it dialed in 90% and then do small changes to get it perfect. 

Current Modifications to the Ender 3 Pro to keep in mind if you are using my Configs to build your own.

This has been a Project over the last year that has made this printer a consistent running machine that requires very little maintenance or adjusting, and has become my template (minus the belted z-axis) for building up all my other Enders.

Thanks to Kevinakasam, Squirrelf, and many many others across r/klipper and r/voron for helping me find code snippets and config files to build up the final product I am running.
