# Ender3Pro-Klipper

I have spent a fair amount of time converting my heavily modified Ender 3 Pro with the Creality v4.2.7
Mainboard to Klipper. After many revisions and significant hardware changes these are my current working config files.

I followed Ellis’ Print Tuning Guide once I had the printer running to tune my printer. I’d suggest if 
you have never done a Klipper Conversion before to follow that tuning guide to the letter. It hasn’t failed 
me yet across multiple printers to get it dialed in 90% and then do small changes after to get it perfect. 

Some things to note:

•	I replaced my bed springs with urethane bed mounts. I suggest using the Screws Tilt Calculate command to level your own bed. 

•	Make sure you go through your printer and tighten everything down before you run any kind of 
  input shaping. You could shake everything loose and lose your bed level or have something fall off.

•	I did leave all of my PID tuning, heightmap, input shaping, and z-offset in the config as this is also 
  my backup for my own printer so be sure to remove and adjust it for your own use. I AM NOT 
  RESPONSEIBLE FOR YOU MESSING UP YOUR OWN PRINTER.

I don’t provide support anywhere actively. That being said I do help with others on r/3dprinting, r/klipper, and r/Ender3 on 
reddit when I have time.
